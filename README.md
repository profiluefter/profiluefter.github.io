## How deployment works

This website is a Next.js Application!
I configured GitHub Actions to automatically build and export it.
It is then copied over to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/profiluefter/profiluefter.github.io/tree/gh-pages)
from where it is available on my domain using GitHub Pages and Cloudflare caching!
