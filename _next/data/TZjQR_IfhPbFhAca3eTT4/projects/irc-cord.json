{"pageProps":{"data":{"description":"I really like the concept of IRC (RFC 2812) and find it unfortunate that it isn't more widespread outside of mainly developers. Reading the IRC was really interesting because it dates back to April 2000 (the original IRC RFC 1459 was created in May 1993) and not at all outdated! So I decided to implement my own IRC server in Go. This is my first Go project and probably my last because there are many things I dislike about Go. It's an \"opinionated\" language after all.\nMy IRC server supports all commands that are needed to communicate in a channel but I might come back to this project later to implement some more e.g. private messages.","links":[{"type":"github","link":"profiluefter/IRCord"}],"startDate":"2020-08-25","endDate":"2020-08-28","id":"irc-cord","language":{"id":"go","name":"Go"},"state":2,"tags":["irc","discord","server","bridge","rfc","implementation"],"teaser":"IRC server that interacts with discord so you can use an IRC client to send discord messages because why not","title":"IRCord","usedTechnologies":[{"id":"go-modules","name":"Go Modules"},{"id":"discordgo","name":"discordgo"}],"related":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
