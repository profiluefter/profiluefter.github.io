{"pageProps":{"data":{"description":"In programming class in school we get provided with tasks via a Moodle instance. Now that I can use IntelliJ instead of Netbeans (the teachers use Netbeans to grade homeworks) because of my Netbeans-Exporter - I wanted to improve my workflow even more: Getting the task, programming it and submitting it in one program.\nThis plugin creates a new Toolbar in IntelliJ with an Overview of the contents of a Moodle course and a detailed view of each task. I'm using the official Moodle API.\nCurrently there is only read access (no submitting yet) and HTML-rendering somewhat works. I'm waiting for the embedded Chromium in IntelliJ to become more widely used so I can use it as well without sacrificing backwards-compatibility too much.","links":[{"type":"github","link":"profiluefter/MoodlePlugin"},{"type":"gitlab","link":"profiluefter/MoodlePlugin"},{"type":"jetbrains","link":"13902"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"id":"moodle-plugin","language":{"id":"java","name":"Java"},"state":3,"title":"Moodle Plugin","teaser":"An Intellij-Plugin that enables using Moodle directly in the IDE","tags":["workflow optimization","school","jetbrains"],"usedTechnologies":[{"id":"gradle","name":"Gradle"},{"id":"intellij","name":"IntelliJ SDK"}],"related":[{"id":"netbeans-exporter","title":"NetBeans Exporter"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
