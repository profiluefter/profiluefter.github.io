{"pageProps":{"data":{"description":"I started this project because I wanted to learn React.js. The Plan was to make a better frontend for GraM, because the PHP-based original would refresh and reset the position on each request. Because of this I started building a (pretty much feature complete) Android App in 2018/19.\nAfter I came up with the idea of this I noticed that this couldn't be done purely client-side because of missing CORS-Headers on the GraM servers. So I created a API with proper CORS-Headers and as an additional benefit: HTTPS\nMy webapp uses Redux to store the global state such as the fetched data. I also implemented Polling using redux-saga which refreshes the data every minute by default. It is also installable as a Progressive Web App and uses client-side asset caching for nearly instant page loading after the first visit. I used a dark themed version of Bootstrap for the design because my own designs look bad :/","links":[{"type":"github","link":"profiluefter/GraM-Frontend"},{"type":"web","link":"https://gram.profiluefter.me"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"id":"gram-frontend","title":"GraM Frontend","teaser":"An alternative React-based Frontend for a teacher's grading system","state":3,"language":{"id":"js","name":"JavaScript"},"tags":["frontend","ci","deployment","alternative","workflow"],"usedTechnologies":[{"id":"react","name":"React.js"},{"id":"npm","name":"NPM"},{"id":"actions","name":"GitHub Actions"},{"id":"bootstrap","name":"Bootstrap"},{"id":"cf-worker","name":"Cloudflare Workers"},{"id":"gh-pages","name":"GitHub Pages"}],"related":[{"id":"grapi","title":"GrAPI"},{"id":"gram-app","title":"GraM Android App"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
